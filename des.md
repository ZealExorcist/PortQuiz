## Ports & Protocols Quiz App
Project Summary: This is a web-based study app designed to help users memorize key ports and protocols for the CompTIA Security+ exam. It offers two quiz modes – Fill-in-the-Blank and Multiple Choice – each with two variations: “Port → Protocol” (given a port number, identify the protocol) and “Protocol → Port” (given a protocol name, identify its port). The interface is text-based but supports optional mnemonic hints or tips to aid memory. Mnemonic devices are well-known to improve retention of large fact sets

, so offering hints (like “HTTPS and its padlock icon” for port 443) helps make the learning easier and even fun

. The app tracks scores locally (using the browser’s localStorage, which persists data across sessions
developer.mozilla.org
) so no server or database is required. It supports both single-player practice and a local two-player mode (e.g. players can take turns or race head-to-head on the same device). In essence, it gamifies exam prep, leveraging interactive quizzes and memory aids to boost engagement and recall.
Tech Stack Recommendation
Backend (Python): Since the user prefers Python, a lightweight Python web framework like Flask is ideal. Flask is a micro web framework (written in Python) that doesn’t impose heavy structure and can serve static pages or small APIs
en.wikipedia.org
. It can serve the HTML/CSS/JS and any data files (e.g. JSON of questions) without needing a full database. (If no server is desired, one could even build the app entirely as a static site, but using Flask makes it easy to extend later.)
Frontend: The app will use HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the client side. A modern JS library or framework can simplify UI development. For example, React (a popular JS library for building interfaces
opensource.fb.com
) or Vue.js (a progressive UI framework
v2.vuejs.org
) can structure the quiz interface with reusable components. These frameworks handle dynamic state (questions, answers, score) and integrate smoothly with browser APIs like localStorage
developer.mozilla.org
. If minimal tooling is desired, even plain JavaScript (with ES6 modules) or a lightweight library (like jQuery) could suffice.
Python in the Browser (Optional): For a “pure Python” approach, one could experiment with PyScript, which lets you run Python code directly in the browser
pyscript.net
. With PyScript you could write quiz logic in Python instead of JS. However, PyScript (a Python-to-WASM technology) is still evolving, so a more common approach is Flask+JS.
Storage: Scores and player stats are stored via the Web Storage API (localStorage), which retains stringified data across sessions
developer.mozilla.org
. This avoids any backend database. Optionally, a lightweight JSON file bundled in the app could store the ports/protocols data.
Other Tools: A CSS framework (e.g. Bootstrap or Tailwind) can speed up styling for a responsive design. Build tools like npm/Webpack (for a React/Vue app) or pipenv/virtualenv (for Python) keep dependencies organized. Testing frameworks (e.g. pytest for any Flask code or Jest for JS) can help ensure reliability.
Overall, a good stack might be Flask + a JS framework: Flask (Python) to serve pages and APIs
en.wikipedia.org
, and React or Vue on the frontend for interactivity. This leverages Python skills while making use of rich browser capabilities (including localStorage and dynamic UI). Alternatively, a fully static single-page app (SPA) built with JS and HTML/CSS could also work; Python is then used just for tooling or data generation.
Project Structure (Files & Folders)
A clear folder layout keeps the project organized. For example:
graphql

├── app.py              # Flask application (or main entrypoint)
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies (e.g. Flask)
├── data/
│   └── questions.json  # JSON file listing port/protocol pairs and hints
├── static/

├── templates/
│   └── index.html      # Main HTML template (if using Flask)
└── README.md           # Project overview and instructions
The data/questions.json file can hold all quiz items: each entry might have { "port": 80, "protocol": "HTTP", "hint": "Web traffic" }, etc. This separates content from code.
static/js/quiz.js (or equivalent) contains the quiz logic: presenting questions, checking answers, and updating scores. It can import or fetch the JSON data.
static/js/storage.js handles saving and retrieving scores from localStorage (no backend needed)
developer.mozilla.org
.
static/css/ holds the styling. Using a CSS framework here can be optional.
If using Flask, app.py sets up routes (e.g. one route for the quiz page), and templates/index.html is the HTML with placeholders that may be filled by Flask or just served as static.
For a purely static approach, index.html could simply be a normal HTML file in the root or under static/, served by a simple HTTP server or GitHub Pages. In that case, Python’s role might be limited to generating questions.json.
This structure is modular: you can easily swap out the frontend or backend pieces, and adding features (e.g. new quiz categories) just means editing data files and static assets.
Libraries and Frameworks
Python/Backend: Flask is recommended for simplicity. Flask is a “micro” web framework (no heavy built-in ORM or form layer)
en.wikipedia.org
, so you can quickly expose routes to serve HTML or JSON. (For a larger scope, Django could be used, but it may be overkill here.)
JavaScript Frontend: Choose a UI library to manage state and components. React (a declarative UI library by Meta) or Vue.js (a progressive framework) are both excellent choices. React’s official description: “React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces”
opensource.fb.com
. Vue calls itself a “progressive framework for building user interfaces”
v2.vuejs.org
. These let you create quiz components (question card, answer form, scoreboard) and handle changes easily. If you prefer minimalism, plain JS with modules can work too.
CSS Framework: Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive layout and quick styling. (Not strictly necessary, but can improve look-and-feel.)
Data/Storage: The browser’s Web Storage API (localStorage) will hold scores
developer.mozilla.org
. No backend database is needed, but if you ever expanded, Flask’s route could easily be extended with a database or file storage.
Miscellaneous: Tools like Flask-RESTful (for API endpoints), Webpack/Parcel (for bundling JS/CSS), and testing libraries (Jest, Mocha for JS or pytest/unittest for Python) can help in development.
In summary, a Flask + React/Vue stack covers Python preference and web interactivity. Alternatively, a static-site approach (pure HTML/CSS/JS, possibly using a static site generator) can eliminate the backend entirely; Python can still generate or preprocess data as needed.
Unique Game Mode: Memory Match Challenge
As a creative learning mode beyond quizzes, consider a Memory Matching Game. In this mode, the user is shown a grid of face-down “cards” (like in the classic concentration game). Half the cards show port numbers and the other half show protocol names. The player flips two cards at a time, trying to match each port with its corresponding protocol. If a pair matches (e.g. card “443” and “HTTPS”), they stay revealed; otherwise they flip back. This reinforces recall by forcing the student to actively retrieve each protocol-port pair. Implementation Outline:
Prepare a deck of card objects from the question data: for each Q, create two cards (one with the port, one with the protocol text).
Shuffle the deck randomly and render it face-down in a grid of <div> elements or <button> elements.
On each turn, the player clicks (flips) a card: show its text. Track the currently flipped cards.
When two are flipped, check for a match (port vs protocol). If they match, mark them solved; if not, flip them back after a short delay.
Score can be based on number of moves or time taken. Players can play solo or take turns, with local two-player mode by counting each player’s matches.
This “flip and match” mechanic is described in many tutorials (e.g. a memory card game built with JS)
geeksforgeeks.org
, and we adapt it to use our port/protocol data.
This mode gamifies learning in a different way – it’s a game-based learning activity that increases engagement and tests memory in a fun format. (Game-based learning is known to boost motivation and information retention through play
legendsoflearning.com
.) By matching cards, users practice recall under a playful challenge.
Modular Design & Scalability Tips
To keep the app maintainable and extensible:
Modular Code: Organize functionality into separate modules. For example, one JS module handles question logic, another handles the UI rendering, and another handles storage. Each module should have a single responsibility (e.g. “QuizController” vs “ScoreManager”)
blog.pixelfreestudio.com
. This makes the code easier to test and update.
Clear Structure: Follow a clear folder structure (as above). Use meaningful names for files and components (e.g. fillBlank.js, multipleChoice.js, memoryGame.js) so others know each part’s role.
Component Reuse: If using a framework like React/Vue, build reusable components (QuestionCard, AnswerForm, ScoreBoard). Reuse these for both quiz modes to avoid duplication.
Data Separation: Keep the data (ports/protocols list) separate from code. Storing questions in JSON means you can update or add new quiz items without touching the logic.
LocalStorage Abstraction: Write a small wrapper library for saving/loading scores in localStorage. This way, if you later move to a backend or change storage strategy, you only adjust one module.
Testing: Even without a backend, write unit tests for your core logic (e.g. answer checking, scoring rules). This ensures changes don’t break functionality.
Progressive Enhancement: Since it’s a purely client-side app, consider making it a Progressive Web App (PWA) so users can install it or use it offline. This is scalable in terms of distribution (just a URL needed)
pyscript.net
.
Version Control and Deployment: Use git for source control, and host on a platform like GitHub Pages or Heroku (Flask) for easy updates. Docker can containerize the Flask app if you anticipate scaling or collaboration.
By keeping each part well-defined and decoupled (front end vs back end, quiz logic vs UI, storage vs presentation), the app will be easier to extend. For example, one could later add more question categories (e.g. UDP vs TCP or descriptions), multiplayer networking, or analytics, without rewriting the whole system. As one article notes, making each module small and focused simplifies understanding and maintenance

. In short, plan the app in layers and components, use clear naming, and separate concerns (UI, logic, data), and the codebase will scale smoothly as features grow. Sources: Framework and design choices are guided by common web development practices
